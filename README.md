# bugdetectiontesting
 Apply existing software bug detection methods/tools to software systems and designing a new software bug detection techniques for software systems

# Extracting Classes and methods from existing large Java systems
 By using a open source tool, java callgraph master (https://github.com/gousiosg/java-callgraph), extract the class and method info from any large Java systems. We will use 3 existing java systems as example and demonstration.
 
# Run the jupyter notebook python file after loading the extracted txt file
potential bugs will be shown in the output
